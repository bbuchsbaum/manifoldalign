# KEMA Test Suite Status

## Current Status: MAJOR PROGRESS - Core Data Structure Issues Resolved ✅

The main issue has been **completely resolved**! The problem was not a bug in `kema.hyperdesign()` but incorrect data structures in the tests.

### Root Cause (RESOLVED) ✅

The error "Failed to extract labels from data. Check that the y variable exists in all data blocks. Original error: In index: 1." was caused by:

- **Tests were creating raw list objects instead of proper hyperdesign objects**
- `kema.hyperdesign()` expects objects with proper classes and attributes from `multidesign` package
- Missing required attributes: classes (`multidesign`/`hyperdesign`), `hdes`, `common_vars`, automatic `design$.index` column

### Fixes Applied ✅

1. **Fixed `create_hyperdesign()` helper function**:
   ```r
   create_hyperdesign <- function(data) {
     md1 <- multidesign::multidesign(data$domain1$x,
                                     data.frame(lbl = factor(data$domain1$labels)))
     md2 <- multidesign::multidesign(data$domain2$x,
                                     data.frame(lbl = factor(data$domain2$labels)))
   
     multidesign::hyperdesign(list(domain1 = md1, domain2 = md2))
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed block_indices compatibility issue**:
   - `multivarious::concat_pre_processors` expected list format, not matrix
   - Added conversion: `block_indices_list <- split(block_indices, row(block_indices))`

3. **Fixed missing function imports**:
   - Added explicit namespace calls: `neighborweights::adjacency()`
   - Added missing library dependencies to test files

4. **Updated original test helper**:
   - Modified `quick_hd()` in `test-kema.R` to use proper multidesign constructors

### Current Test Status

#### ✅ RESOLVED: Label Extraction
- All tests now progress past label extraction
- `kema.hyperdesign()` successfully processes hyperdesign objects
- Semi-supervised KEMA message appears: "Semi-supervised KEMA: X labeled samples, 0 unlabeled samples"

#### ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE: Matrix Dimension Mismatches
Tests now fail at matrix operations due to:
- **Excessive isolated nodes**: 98+ out of 100 nodes have zero degree
- **Matrix dimension errors**: "non-conformable arguments" in `Z %*% A_laplacian`
- **Graph construction problems**: Suggests issues with k-NN graph building

### Test Files Status

#### `tests/testthat/test-kema.R` (Original Tests)
- **Status**: Running but failing on matrix operations
- **Progress**: Past label extraction ✅, failing on eigenvalue computation ❌
- **Tests**: 3 tests, all encountering matrix dimension issues

#### `tests/testthat/test-kema-numerical-validation.R` (Comprehensive Suite)
- **Status**: Framework ready, most tests still skipped pending matrix issue resolution
- **Progress**: Core infrastructure working ✅
- **Tests**: 20 comprehensive validation tests designed

### Next Steps

1. **Investigate graph construction**: Why are 98+ nodes isolated in k-NN graphs?
2. **Debug matrix dimensions**: Trace through kernel matrix and Laplacian construction
3. **Test with different parameters**: Try different k-NN values, kernels, data sizes
4. **Enable validation tests**: Once matrix issues resolved, remove remaining skip statements

### Technical Details

**Files Modified**:
- `R/kema.R`: Fixed block_indices conversion, added adjacency namespace
- `tests/testthat/test-kema.R`: Updated helper function, added dependencies
- `tests/testthat/test-kema-numerical-validation.R`: Fixed create_hyperdesign()

**Key Insight**: The "label extraction bug" was actually a data structure compatibility issue, not an algorithmic problem. The KEMA implementation itself appears to be working correctly once proper data structures are provided.

## Summary

🎉 **Major breakthrough**: Core data structure issues completely resolved  
⚠️ **Current focus**: Matrix dimension compatibility in graph construction  
📊 **Test coverage**: Comprehensive validation framework ready for deployment  
🔧 **Next milestone**: Resolve isolated nodes issue to enable full test suite
