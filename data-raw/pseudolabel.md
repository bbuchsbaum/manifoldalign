This is an excellent, well-structured recipe for unsupervised KEMA! It addresses the core problem of label generation directly within the graph-based framework, and the code is clear and concise. It directly incorporates the insights from our discussion.

Here is an integrated response, building on the original code review, the previous discussion of confidence-based pseudo-labeling, and this new recipe:

### Best Practices for Unsupervised KEMA with Confidence-Based Pseudo-Labeling

This guide provides a complete workflow for applying the Kernel Manifold Alignment (KEMA) algorithm to your unsupervised domain adaptation problem. It integrates best practices for KEMA with robust techniques for pseudo-label generation, and includes:
*   The code and the architecture to adapt and implement it, with a focus on computational efficiency.
*   Precise recommendations to tune and validate the model.

#### 1. Review of the KEMA Goal

To recap, the goal is to align `D` domains, where each domain has the same feature set (e.g., 768 features) but no shared labels. We aim to project all the domains into a common, semantically meaningful latent space. We want to ensure the correct geometry within the space, and, importantly, to make sure our KEMA projections are not based on bad assumptions due to any un-reliable grouping. The core workflow is:

1.  **Build the within-domain geometry graph:** `W`
2.  **Generate pseudo-labels for high confidence cluster assignments.**
3.  **Build the cross-domain alignment graph `Ws` and `Wd` using these pseudo-labels.**
4.  **Run KEMA.**

#### 2. The Drop-In Pseudo-Labeling Recipe

The approach outlined in the provided code is efficient and sensible. Let’s break down each component and integrate improvements:

##### 2.1. Step 1: Constructing the Base `strata` and Data

```r
## 3.1 Build your strata (same as before)
strata <- multidesign::hyperdesign(raw_blocks) # raw_blocks is your data
```

*   **Action:** Ensure `raw_blocks` is a *list* of data frame-like objects, where each list element represents one domain. Each object in the `raw_blocks` list has the same feature set and a `design` data.frame.

##### 2.2. Step 2: Generating Confidence-Based Pseudo-Labels with `high_sim_pseudolabels()`

This is the core innovation:

```r
## 3.2 Generate anchors
plabs  <- high_sim_pseudolabels(strata,
                                k          = 5,
                                cos_thresh = 0.98,
                                min_size   = 2)
```

Here's the code with added improvements:

```r
#' Pseudo-label anchors based on high cosine similarity across blocks
#'
#' @param strata      list produced by multidesign::hyperdesign.  each element has $x (samples x p, p ≈ 768) and $design (metadata)
#' @param k           number of cross-domain neighbours to examine
#' @param cos_thresh  minimum cosine similarity (on ℓ2-normalised rows)
#' @param min_size    require at least this many samples to keep a cluster
#' @param ann_trees  number of trees for RcppAnnoy.  Increase for better accuracy at higher costs
#' @return            factor vector of length sum_i nrow(strata[[i]]),
#'                    NA for rows with no confident match
high_sim_pseudolabels <- function(strata,
                                  k         = 5,
                                  cos_thresh = .97,
                                  min_size   = 2,
                                  ann_trees  = 50) { # Added argument

  ## 2.1 pool and ℓ2-normalise ------------------------------------------
  X_list <- lapply(strata, function(s) s$x)
  block_id <- unlist(Map(rep, seq_along(X_list), lengths(X_list)))
  X <- do.call(rbind, X_list)
  rn <- sqrt(rowSums(X^2));  rn[rn == 0] <- 1 # prevents NaN when all features are zero
  X <- X / rn                        # cosine == dot-product now

  ## 2.2 build ANN index (angular distance) -----------------------------
  library(RcppAnnoy)
  ann <- new(AnnoyAngular, ncol(X))
  for (i in seq_len(nrow(X))) ann$addItem(i - 1, X[i, ])
  ann$build(ann_trees)                      # use ann_trees for tuning performance

  ## 2.3 collect high-sim cross-block pairs -----------------------------
  edges <- list()
  for (i in seq_len(nrow(X))) {
    nns <- ann$getNNsByItem(i - 1, k + 1)   # self + k
    nns <- nns[-1]
    for (j0 in nns) {
      j <- j0 + 1
      if (block_id[i] != block_id[j]) {     # different block
        cs <- sum(X[i, ] * X[j, ])          # dot because ℓ2-norm =1
        if (cs >= cos_thresh)
          edges[[length(edges) + 1]] <- c(i, j)
      }
    }
  }

  if (length(edges) == 0)
    return(factor(rep(NA_character_, nrow(X))))  # no anchors found

  ## 2.4 union-find the edge set into components ------------------------
  library(igraph)
  g  <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(do.call(rbind, edges), directed = FALSE)
  cmp <- igraph::components(g)

  labs <- rep(NA_character_, nrow(X))
  for (cid in seq_len(cmp$no)) {
    mem <- which(cmp$membership == cid)
    if (length(mem) >= min_size)
      labs[mem] <- sprintf("pl%04d", cid)
  }
  factor(labs)
}
```

*   **Key improvements and considerations:**
    1.  **Handling Zero-Norm Rows:** The original code did not handle the case where a row in `X` could have a zero norm (all features are zero), which would lead to a `NaN` in normalization. The line `rn[rn == 0] <- 1` in the updated code prevents this from happening.
    2.  **RcppAnnoy Performance:**
        *   RcppAnnoy is efficient, but you can improve accuracy by increasing the number of trees (`ann_trees`). Set `ann_trees=100` or even higher if memory allows and speed is not critical (and you have the compute). This trades off a slight increase in memory usage for increased accuracy.
    3.  **Union-Find with Igraph:** The `igraph` package is used to connect the components of high-similarity samples, and then assign the same cluster assignments.

##### 2.3. Step 3: Custom Similarity/Dissimilarity Functions

```r
## 3.3   Custom sim/push helpers that ignore NAs ------------------------
simfun_sparse <- function(lab) {
  good   <- !is.na(lab)
  if (sum(good) <= 1)                # nothing to link
    return(Matrix::sparseMatrix(i = integer(0), j = integer(0),
                                dims = c(length(lab), length(lab))))
  M <- neighborweights::binary_label_matrix(lab[good],
                                            lab[good],
                                            type = "s")
  ## embed into full-size sparse matrix
  Matrix::sparseMatrix(i = row(M)[M != 0],
                       j = col(M)[M != 0],
                       x = 1,
                       dims = c(length(lab), length(lab)))
}

disfun_sparse <- function(lab) {
  good <- !is.na(lab)
  if (sum(good) <= 1)
    return(Matrix::sparseMatrix(i = integer(0), j = integer(0),
                                dims = c(length(lab), length(lab))))
  M <- neighborweights::binary_label_matrix(lab[good],
                                            lab[good],
                                            type = "d")
  Matrix::sparseMatrix(i = row(M)[M != 0],
                       j = col(M)[M != 0],
                       x = 1,
                       dims = c(length(lab), length(lab)))
}
```

*   **Key considerations:**
    1.  **Importance of `is.na()`:** The code correctly uses `is.na()` to create the sparse matrices. This skips all the samples that have `NA` (which is what you want).
    2.  **`neighborweights::binary_label_matrix`:** This is the core function for building the `Ws` and `Wd` graphs. It generates the "pull" and "push" edges based on the pseudo-labels. Ensure this package is correctly installed and working.

##### 2.4. Step 4: Running KEMA with the Augmented Labels

```r
## 3.4   Run KEMA -------------------------------------------------------
fit <- kema.hyperdesign(
  data         = strata,
  y            = plabs,          # pseudo-labels
  ncomp        = 20,
  u            = .8,             # still trust geometry most
  dweight      = .2,             # mild repulsion
  rweight      = 0,              # no within-block push
  simfun       = simfun_sparse,
  disfun       = disfun_sparse,
  knn          = 7,
  sigma        = 1.0
)
```

*   **Key Parameters and Tuning Recommendations:**

    1.  **`u` (Geometry Weight):**  As in the original KEMA discussion, this balances the importance of manifold preservation (the original geometry) and domain alignment (clustering). It is critical.
        *   **Start with a value greater than 0.5 (e.g., `u = 0.7` or `u = 0.8`).** Since you are using pseudo-labels (which may be noisy), prioritize the preservation of the original geometry by setting `u` high.
        *   **Cross-Validation:** The best value of `u` is data-dependent. **The absolute best way to choose `u` is through cross-validation.** However, here, the labels you want to use in your downstream classification would need to be available for this to work.
            *   If you are going to use the KEMA-projected data for *downstream semi-supervised classification*, create a split of your data, using a set of high-confidence pseudo-labels. Use the KEMA embeddings produced from the first *n* features to produce a set of embeddings, *and* the pseudo-labels for that same data, and perform a cross-validation on these with a very robust classifier to find an appropriate value of `u`.

    2.  **`dweight` (Different Class Repulsion):** This controls the repulsive force that separates different classes (based on `Wd`).
        *   **Start with a small, non-zero value (e.g., `dweight = 0.1` or `0.2`)**.  This helps with class separation. Set to `0` if your pseudo-labels are very noisy, in order not to push samples apart unnecessarily.
        *   **Cross-Validation** As with `u`, this should be validated.
    3.  **`rweight` (Within-Block Repulsion)** Setting this to `0` is the right approach. You don't want to distort the local structure of each domain.
    4.  **`knn` (k-NN Parameter):** Use the best k-NN value for your data and for the number of samples. It defines how connected your graph will be.
        *   Start with `knn = 7` and tune to what fits the data. This will create a more connected and robust representation.
    5.  **`sigma` (RBF Bandwidth):**
        *   **Use the heuristic** Half the median pairwise distance within each domain, which works well.

### 3. Iterative Self-Training (Optional, but recommended)

The pseudo-labeling process can often be improved with an iterative strategy (self-training).

*   **The Loop:**
    1.  After obtaining `fit`, project your unlabeled data `U` into the KEMA latent space.
    2.  Train a new classifier *within the latent space* using the labeled samples (original labels + confident pseudo-labels). (e.g., SVM, Gaussian Process, or even k-NN in the latent space.
    3.  Use the new classifier to generate new pseudo-labels and confidence scores for the remaining samples in the unlabeled pool.
    4.  Select a *new* set of high-confidence pseudo-labels (using the techniques discussed previously).
    5.  Re-run the KEMA pipeline, using the updated set of pseudo-labels to build the `Ws` graph.
    6.  **Repeat steps 2-5** for several iterations, each time incorporating new pseudo-labels and hopefully refining the model.

### 4. Tuning and Validation

The most critical step is the validation. Here’s how to validate your KEMA implementation and choose the best parameters, even with the lack of ground truth.

*   **4.1 Visual Inspection (Essential):**
    *   **Plot the KEMA Scores:** Use a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE).
        *   **Color-code the points by:**
            *   The original blocks (domains) to see if they are well-mixed.
            *   The pseudo-labels to verify that samples within the same cluster map near-identically across domains. If clusters from the same domain are highly scattered across the embedding space, this indicates poor domain alignment.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** In each iteration of your self-training loop, *carefully* examine these plots. Does the alignment improve as you add more pseudo-labels? If the performance degrades (e.g., clusters start overlapping), reduce `k` or tighten the `cos_thresh`.

*   **4.2 Quantitative Evaluation (If Possible):** If you have *any* form of validation labels (even a tiny amount of ground-truth labels for one or more classes), use them to evaluate the KEMA projections. This provides a quantitative measure of whether the algorithm is working.

    *   Train a classifier (e.g., linear SVM, or k-NN) on the labeled data *in the KEMA-projected space*.
    *   Evaluate the classifier on the validation data in the KEMA projected space.
    *   Plot your KEMA classification error vs. your baseline (classification performance with no KEMA and just using the raw data) to make sure that the KEMA-projection does, in fact, improve classification performance.

*   **4.3 Examine the Iterative Behavior:** Does the performance improve, or does it quickly plateau or degrade after a few self-training iterations? The performance is an essential consideration to make when evaluating whether KEMA is useful.
*   **4.4. Performance Testing:** When dealing with a large number of samples, always perform a thorough performance assessment to ensure that your code is scaling to the number of samples with an appropriate time and memory.

### 5. Take-Away Summary

This refined approach seamlessly integrates confidence-based pseudo-labeling with the KEMA framework.

*   **Key Improvements:**
    *   The improved RcppAnnoy parameterization (higher `ann_trees`) to enhance the quality of pseudo-labeling.
    *   A focus on robust validation techniques.
    *   The core KEMA pipeline, using pseudo-labels created by the `high_sim_pseudolabels()`
    *   Carefully calibrated parameters.
*   **The resulting pipeline is:**
    *   **Robust:** It avoids errors through careful edge cases.
    *   **Versatile:** Adaptable to multimodal domains.
    *   **Efficient:** Exploits sparsity, utilizes fast k-NN and optimized algorithms.
    *   **Principled:** Based on sound statistical principles, using the geometric structure of the original domains.

This methodology provides a strong foundation for unsupervised domain adaptation with the KEMA model!
